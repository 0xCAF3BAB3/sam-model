# AMLmodel_v1
Initial version.

# AMLmodel_v2
Removed InterfaceClassLib "CommunicationInterfaceClassLib".
Adapted RoleClassLib "CommunicationRoleClassLib" to match new code-architecture (see commit https://bitbucket.org/0xCAF3BAB3/pushlistener-code-architecture/commits/e6b610886daff5da449919eb8ef27b1caac29e37).
Adapted InstanceHierarchy to the above changes.

# AMLmodel_v3
Removed BusinessRoleClassLib and its assignments in InstanceHierarchy because it is currently not used for code-generation.
Renamed IH IE "PushListenerSystem" in "Service".
Renamed IH IEs "Node1", "Node2" and "Node3" in "Component1", "Component2" and "Component3".
Renamed IE "CommunicationPorts" (located inside every component) in "Ports".
Adapted RoleClassLib "CommunicationRoleClassLib":
 o IE "Port" is not divided into Receiver and Sender and its concrete implementations anymore like it was in AMLmodel_v2.
 o Instead, IE "Port" is directly assigned to every port.
 o And an additional IE "PortStyle" is assigned to every port to indicate communication-style (Rmi, Udp, etc.).
 o And an additional IE "PortType" is assigned to every port to indicate communication-type (Receiver, Sender, etc.).
 o And an additional IE "PortParameters" is assigned to every port, which holds further communication-configuration-parameters (Rmi parameters, Udp parameters, etc.).
   e.g. PortParameters.Rmi.hostname or PortParameters.Rmi.portRegistry
 --> Better global view instead of very specialized view.
Adapted InstanceHierarchy to the above changes.
